Daggerwalk is a collection of technologies that live-stream a bot endlessly walking through the massive game world of The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall (1996).

This repo contains scripts and utilities for the machine that runs the game and Twitch bot, as well as the Daggerfall Unity C# scripts for my custom mods of DFU used with Daggerwalk.
